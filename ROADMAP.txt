# ROADMAP

This quick and dirty document just list the roadmap tasks.

## Renaming project

- replace spotifagent occurrences almost everywhere...

## Sync

- spotify: fetch user songs (liked song)
- spotify: fetch all playlists to collect all the user's song (to don't get recommendations for them)

## Recommendations / Suggestions

- spotify: search endpoint to discover new musics?
- found other providers for recommendations (listenbrainz or musicbrainz)?
    => last.fm: works pretty great with latino sounds, but only :/ hip-hop/rap FR not supported at all
    => tastedive API

## Playlist (recommendations)

- spotify: create a user playlist

## AI agents

Once the project is stable, try to auto-generate the agents scripts
