# ROADMAP

This quick and dirty document just list the roadmap tasks.

## refacto hexa:

- OAuthProviderUserToken => from_token_state and to_token_state: should be the opposite no? Or mappers?
- rename or review the schema OAuthProviderTokenState: delete it (used only for the client provider)? Rename it?

## doc code

- improve the doc code for domain / critical stuff: entities, etc

## Test

- review integration test on api endpoint with spotify to use httpx mock instead of mock (two test only)...?

## Dependencies

- replace poetry by UV?

## Entities / models

### Music

- should we add a relationship between the track with the (top) artist?

## Renaming project

- replace museflow occurrences almost everywhere...

## Logging

- Review to improve it! We have almost nothing!

## Sync

- review it for a top level batch handling (to release memory yb saving in DB before) + atomicity?
- spotify: import the extended streaming history?

## Recommendations / Suggestions

- spotify: search endpoint to discover new musics?
- found other providers for recommendations (listenbrainz or musicbrainz)?
    => last.fm: works pretty great with latino sounds, but only :/ hip-hop/rap FR not supported at all
    => tastedive API

## Playlist (recommendations)

- spotify: create a user playlist
