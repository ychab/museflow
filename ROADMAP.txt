# ROADMAP

This quick and dirty document just list the roadmap tasks.

## doc code

- improve the doc code for tests

## Dependencies

- replace poetry by UV?

## Entities/ models Music

- should we add a relationship between the track with the (top) artist?
- should we have a slug based on the track name + artist name?

## Sync

- review it for performance (small chunks to upsert into DB) and atomicity?
- spotify: import the extended streaming history?

## Recommendations / Suggestions

- spotify: get corresponding matching + search endpoint to discover new musics?
- found other providers for recommendations (listenbrainz or musicbrainz)?
    => last.fm: works pretty great with latino sounds, but only :/ hip-hop/rap FR not supported at all
    => tastedive API

## Playlist (recommendations)

- spotify: create a user playlist
